## Magic Star Studio

### Beginning
When I was in elementary school, the information technology class was my favorite. Every time we had class, the teacher would teach us to use a software called **Scratch** with a **yellow cat icon**. I could always complete all the puzzle tasks with ease. Since I was always the first to finish and submit, the teacher noticed my talent, which filled me with pride and planted the seed of game development in my heart.

- Origin of the Studio  
In my first year of high school, I first encountered Unity. After self-studying for some time, I was able to create some **pretty decent** üò∞ games. That's when **Magic Star Studio** was born on **April 19, 2021**. The origin of the studio's name is quite strange: a sudden thought popped into my mind, and a great name appeared before me‚Äîtwo bold characters, **"Magic Star"** ü§©. Well, okay... It was just those two words that came to mind out of the blue. Who knows what innocent thoughts I had at that time. But if I had to give a reason, it's because I hoped the games produced by our studio could shine like stars in the sky, loved and admired by people; as for the word **"Magic"**, it's simply because it's really **Cool** ü§ìüëç.

- Initial Members of the Studio  
Magic Star Studio didn't have many members at first, and they were all my junior high school classmates. I vaguely remember there were only a few of us, and most of them were involved in **"game testing"** and **"game promotion"**, which meant no one in the studio could participate in game programming. I took on everything by myself‚Äîit seems like I still do, haha. Their encouragement and support were one of the fundamental driving forces behind my game development back then. It was a joyful and fulfilling time that I still cherish to this day.

### Development
The broadening of my horizons during junior high school made me not content with the immediate present.

- Developing My Skills  
Why weren't the games fun? Because I lacked skills in game development. How could "half-assed skills" kick open the door to **indie games**? When the game testers repeatedly reported many **"bugs"**, I made up my mind to delve into game engines‚Äîspecifically, Unity. Back then, as soon as I finished my homework, I would start watching videos to learn. This process helped me accumulate a lot of experience in game development and also produced many **"embarrassing"** works.

- Expanding My Skills  
Apart from Unity, during junior high school, I also extensively learned many other things, such as **Unreal** (Unreal Engine), **WebStorm** (front-end web development), **Blender** (modeling), **Bandlab** (music production), **Flash** (animation), and **PS** (Photoshop for graphics). In high school, inspired by watching "Boogiepop Phantom," I impulsively learned to play the **electric guitar**. Although I learned a lot of things but didn't delve deeply into any one of them, they all converged to lay a solid foundation for my later indie game development.

- Changes in Studio Members  
As I met many new friends in high school, the number of studio members increased slightly (to 22). My former junior high school classmates seemed to rarely speak in the studio group anymore. But that's understandable, as we all went our separate ways...Later, some people joined Fantasy Star Studio voluntarily and offered help, which truly touched me. Here, I express my gratitude to them! üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è

### <del>Climax</del> Current Status

- Milestones  
During the summer vacation of 2024, I planned to participate in an indie game development competition and ultimately decided on the **TIG** indie game development competition. I embarked on a **50-day** journey of indie game development (for "Pirate Spire"), and after encountering a series of issues, I submitted my application on **August 27th**. I'm currently waiting for the results... Regardless of the outcome, the moment I completed and uploaded the game was the most exciting and proud moment of my game development career so far. It will be a **milestone**.

When I finished writing this brief introduction to the Magic Star Studio, its history was still advancing over time...
